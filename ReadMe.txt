I think I went pretty above and beyond when it comes to how very easy it is to use this search engine.
Firstly I added plugins that greatly enhances the user's experience, such as the bootstrap tabs,
the table plugin that makes the table very very easy to use, and also the user of the accordion layouts
to make going throw the provided data a breeze.  I also rewrote a bunch of the starter html to make it
look prettier and allow the user the easiest and most simplest interface to use.  The table layout for
the search query is also super easy to use and allows searching within the search results, how cool is that!
Long story short, this is a solid piece of software.
